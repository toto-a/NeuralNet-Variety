## Some projects reagarding neural nets in general (fine tuning llm, 3d reconstruction, vision based application, ...)

For example, see [here](https://github.com/toto-a/NeuralNet-Variety/tree/main/Mistral_streamlit) for a working chatbot using mistral-7b.

[Here](https://github.com/toto-a/NeuralNet-Variety/tree/main/ViT_scratch) for an implementation from scratch of a vision transformer

[Here](https://github.com/toto-a/NeuralNet-Variety/tree/main/Edge_detection) for some edge detection using opencv dnn and a semi automatic canny

[Here](https://github.com/toto-a/NeuralNet-Variety/tree/main/SIREN) for an implementaion of SIREN
